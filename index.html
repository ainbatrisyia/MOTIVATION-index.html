<center> Online Education </center> </h1>It has been norm to all people in the world right now, it is because of the <abbr title="Corona Virus"
>Covid-19</abbr> pandemic that had happened and still is. So, in order to stay educated and bring the college or schoo vibes to home, online learning it is. It may be hard for some people who did not have the convenience at home, but the government really helpful in this situation as they help all the colleges' students to get a free internet at home, so it will be easier for them to access internet and to settle down things need to be done. Somehow, there is a few motivation towards online education for the students in order to do well in their studies with a new method which is online learning.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, the motivation towards online education is <em>to have a productive day</em>. During this pandemic, the people especially student usually have a lot of free time and did not know what to do at home. So, it is better for them to have a class which in online education to help them to fullfil their leisure time rather than for them to waste their time doing the things they did not supposed to. By having online education their day will be more productive and they will not left behind in courses that they had take. The student will keep on track on what they had learn and it is easier for them memorize, better understand and ready for the finals.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, the motivation towards online education is they will have a <em>better communication skills</em>. It is because they will communicate often with their lecturer and friends. Although they communicate visually, at least they have a courage to talk and ask them personally or in a group. Nevertheless, they will have a good bonding with each other. So, when this pandemic is over, in other words is in real life they will have a better realtionship with each other and for the students and lecturer the students will have a better understanding<sub>(the students will become more comfortable with lecturer to ask anything they want to know more or something they do not understand)</sub></p>
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, the motivation towards online education is <em>experience on having working from home</em>. If there is unexpected things happens in the future at least we can already accomodate ourselves in that situation and we will have better strategy on how to productively working/studying from home. 
</p>

<p>
Forthly, the motivation towards online education is <em>to stay educated</em>. If we not having a online education during this pandemic we tend to do nothing, and become skill-less. Online education helps us to stay educated and if we stop learning our brain will become less functioning and we will not do well.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the motivation towards online education is <em>to graduate on time</em>. I think this is they biggest motivation for the students to have online education, it is because to finish studies on time. Eventhough, it is hard for them to get used to online education, but they still trying. This new method of studying is so hard but they have to experience it anyway. Besides, they want to graduate on time because they want to get  a job and enjoy their new phase of life which is working phase.

<small>My motivation quote in my life is</small><q> These mountains that you are carrying, you were only supposed to climb.</q>

<p>
<ins>This is my <del>least</del> most favourite quotation websites from my favourite author</ins> <sup>(Najwa Zebian)</sup> <ins> in order to stay motivate:</ins> 
</p>

<blockquote cite=https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/14879821.Najwa_Zebian><mark>Whatever you do, do it with purpose. Being focused is not something to be ashamed of. It is something to be proud of. When you know what are you are doing and have a clear vision of where you are going, you will not need to chase opportunities. Opportunities will seek you. Happiness will chase you. And, instead of being a choice, you will be the one choosing.</mark></blockquote>

<p>p/s-together we prayed that this <abbr title="Corona Virus"
>Covid-19</abbr> will be over so that we will live back to normal.
